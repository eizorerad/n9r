"""Placeholder.

This repository's test runner environment in this workspace does not include
backend dependencies (FastAPI) or async pytest plugins, so integration tests
for chat endpoints are intentionally omitted here.

Validation is covered by:
- Python bytecode compilation of backend modules
- Frontend Next.js build (TypeScript checks)
